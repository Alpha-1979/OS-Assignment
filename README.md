# OS-Assignment
This assignment is based on implementation of Banker's algorithm.
Here we have to write a multithreaded program that implements the banker's algorithm first let’s see what’s a multithreaded program is, a multithreaded program or application are those that run more than one thread in its process. Which, in the real world, are, basically, all out there. Now let’s talk about, what is Banker’s Algorithm? The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state”(safe-state) check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.  It is named so because this algorithm is used in banking systems to determine whether a loan can be granted or not.
